 Hi, I'm Amrendra N Mishra

I design and deliver resilient, enterprise-grade Java Backend systems and scalable architectures that power critical business functions. Most of my work is focused on production readiness: clean, tested code, high-performance API design, and robust deployment pipelines in the cloud.

What I Build and Contribute
🛠️ Java Backend Services: Mission-critical microservices using Spring Boot, focusing on high concurrency, data integrity, and low-latency performance.

☁️ Cloud-Native Architectures: Implementing cost-effective, highly available solutions leveraging AWS services (Lambda, EC2, S3, RDS, DynamoDB).

⚙️ System Integration: Designing and implementing secure and efficient RESTful and gRPC APIs for seamless cross-platform communication.

🌐 Full-Stack Context: Contributing to Frontend components (React/Angular) to ensure complete alignment between services and user experience.

📚 Open Source Contributions: Focus on system design patterns, clean architecture templates, and optimized Spring Boot starter kits.

About Me
